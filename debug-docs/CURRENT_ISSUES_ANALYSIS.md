# Current Issues Analysis

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Problems Found**

### **1. Paint Mode Completely Broken**
**Problem**: Only shows red tiles, no proper blockout behavior
**Expected**: Should carve empty spaces and fill solid areas like original
**Root Cause**: Changed the fundamental tile painting logic

### **2. Select Mode Acting Like Drag Mode**
**Problem**: Cells immediately start dragging instead of selecting
**Expected**: Click to select, then drag to move
**Root Cause**: Removed proper selection state management

### **3. Colored Borders Everywhere**
**Problem**: Random colored borders around cells
**Expected**: Clean cell selection highlighting
**Root Cause**: Outline system is broken and showing wrong data

### **4. Panning/Zooming Buggy**
**Problem**: Viewport controls don't work properly
**Expected**: Smooth pan and zoom like original
**Root Cause**: Coordinate system and event handling issues

### **5. Pattern Library Debug Messages**
**Problem**: Console spam from disabled features
**Expected**: Clean console
**Root Cause**: Left debug messages in disabled modules

## ðŸŽ¯ **Fix Strategy**

1. **Restore Original Paint Logic** - Copy working paint behavior from backup
2. **Fix Selection System** - Proper click-to-select, then drag behavior
3. **Fix Outline System** - Only show outlines for active cells
4. **Fix Viewport Controls** - Restore working pan/zoom
5. **Clean Up Debug Messages** - Remove console spam
6. **Preserve Working Features** - Keep export, settings, checker pattern

The refactor was too aggressive and changed core behaviors instead of just modularizing them.
