# Original Behavior Analysis

## ðŸš¨ **Current Issues vs Original**

### **1. Paint Mode - COMPLETELY BROKEN**
**Current**: Only works on single clicks, no continuous painting
**Original**: Should work with mouse drag for continuous painting
**Root Cause**: Missing continuous drawing logic during mouse drag

### **2. Outline Overlay - MISUNDERSTOOD**
**Current**: Not working at all
**Original**: Shows visual outlines around cells that have content, NOT selection borders
**Root Cause**: Confused outline system with selection highlighting

### **3. Selection Mode - COMPLETELY DIFFERENT**
**Current**: Click to select, then drag
**Original**: Should work with rectangle selection and different behaviors
**Root Cause**: Completely different selection system

### **4. Panning - STILL BROKEN**
**Current**: "Getting better" but still shit
**Original**: Smooth panning with proper constraints
**Root Cause**: Viewport system not properly implemented

## ðŸŽ¯ **What I Need to Do**

1. **Study the original code** to understand the actual behaviors
2. **Fix continuous painting** - mouse drag should paint continuously
3. **Fix outline system** - should show cell content outlines, not selection
4. **Fix selection system** - restore original rectangle selection behavior
5. **Fix panning** - make it work like the original

I need to stop making assumptions and actually read the original code properly.
